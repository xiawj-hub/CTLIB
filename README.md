## Installation
Make sure PyTorch and CUDA have been installed correctly and then
```
python setup.py install
```

For linux installation, remove `library_dirs` and `extra_link_args` in setup.py first.

You may fail to install this lib because the bug of pytorch, you can search the error code and find the solution in Stackoverflow.
The verified environments include
1) Win 10, CUDA 10.2 pytorch > 1.7.0
2) Linux 16.04, CUDA 10.2 pytorch 1.7.0
3) Linux 18.04, CUDA 11.3 pytorch 1.10.0

## API
``projection(image, options)``: Projector of CT

``projection_t(projection, options)``: Transpose of projector

``backprojection_t(image, options)``: Transpose of backprojector

``backprojection(projection, options)``: Backprojector of CT

``fbp(projection, options)``: FBP with RL filter

``laplacian(input, k)``: Computation of adjancency matrix in [3]

``image``: 4D torch tensor, B x 1 x H x W,

``projection``: 4D torch tensor, B x 1 x V x D, V is the total number of scanning views, D is the total number of detector bins

``options``: 12D torch vector for fan beam and 9D torch vector for parallel beam, scanning geometry parameters, including

``views``: Number of scanning views

``dets``: Number of detector bins

``width`` and ``height``: Spatial resolution of images

``dImg``: Physical length of a pixel

``dDet``: Interval between two adjacent detector bins, especially, interval is ``rad`` for equal angle fan beam

``Ang0``: Starting angle

``dAng``: Interval between two adjacent scanning views: ``rad``

``s2r``: The distance between x-ray source and rotation center, not needed in parallel beam

``d2r``: The distance between detector and roration center, not needed in parallel beam

``binshift``: The shift of the detector

``scan_type``: ``0`` is equal distance fan beam, ``1`` is euql angle fan beam and ``2`` is parallel beam
